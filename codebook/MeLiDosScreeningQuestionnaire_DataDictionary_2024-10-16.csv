explanation,online_screening_consent_form,,descriptive,"<div class=""rich-text-field-label""><h2>Welcome!</h2> <hr /> <p>Many thanks for your interest in our study ""Light exposure in daily life""! </p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Before we invite you to our facility at the Georg-Brauchle-Ring, we would like to </span>make sure that you are eligible for this study<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.

The total duration of the study is</span> 1 week (from Monday to Monday)<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. Participation in the study involves the following steps:</span></p> <ol> <li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This short </span>screening questionnaire, <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">which contains demographic and health questions. After finishing this questionnaire and if you are eligible, we will contact you to take part in this study via the e-mail address that we will ask you to provide. Together, we will agree on a date to start the experiment.<br /><br /></span></li> <li>On the Monday of the experimental week, <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you will come to our laboratory at Georg-Brauchle-Ring in the afternoon. Here, you will fill in </span>two questionnaires<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> about your </span>chronotype <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and we will give you </span>the light logging sensor. <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This consists of a small light sensor placed on the frame of a pair of black, non-prescription glasses (variable sizes are available). Furthermore, we will give you a</span> light logger with a wristband and a necklace band<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.<br /><br /></span></li> <li>During the experimental week, <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you will</span> wear all devices continuously<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and only take them off during showering or contact sports. During sleep, we will ask you to place the light logger somewhere in your room (e.g. bedside table). Furthermore, during the week, you will</span> complete daily sleep, wellbeing, exercise, and light exposure diaries directly on your phone <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">through an </span>app.<br /><br /></li> <li>At the end of the week (i.e. the following Monday), <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you will come back to the lab in the morning and we will ask you to</span> complete questionnaires about your light exposure and light sensitivity<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. We will also ask you about </span>your experiences with wearing our light logging device<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. </span></li> </ol> <hr /> <h3>Will I get reimbursed?</h3> <p>You will receive compensation for participating in this study.<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> For</span> each day<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> of wearing the light logger devices, </span>you will receive €10<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. Please note that this daily compensation will</span> only<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> be applied </span>if you<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>wear the devices more than 80% of your awake time per day. <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This means that, if you comply with this criterion, we will give you </span>a total of €80 on the final day of the study.</p> <hr /> <h3>What happens with my data?</h3> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sensitive data about you and your health will be collected in this study.
